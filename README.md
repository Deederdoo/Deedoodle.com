Website to show my projects, since shutdown due to server costs.

I love space, I thought it would be could to create an animation using JavaScript and a game loop.

The original purpose of this website was to give people a view of graphics cards that have been "dropping" in stores since there was a large drought.
I built a webscapper that would run on my raspberry pie 24/7 to pull information from certain websites so I could build data and show people
charts of information of price / time / amounts / etc... I would then send this data to my server to be pushed into a database. Anyone that could
visit the webpage would have access to this information on a live chart.

This is an old image I managed to find, it's an early version of the scapper application working.

I also had a little fun building a space game using the same gameloop as the menu screen. The goal of the game is to kill as many aliens as possible
before you get overrun. Players were able to submit their score at the end.

The last section of the website was for my porfolio. I display the code for some of my projects in a scrollable format and also having an
about section to talk about myself and hobbies I enjoy doing.
