Website to show my projects, since shutdown due to server costs.

I love space, I thought it would be could to create an animation using JavaScript and a game loop.

The original purpose of this website was to give people a view of graphics cards that have been "dropping" in stores since there was a large drought.
I build a webscapper that would run on my raspberry pie 24/7 to pull information from certain websites so I could build data and show people
charts of information of price / time / amounts / etc... I would then send this data to my server and filled into a database. Anyone that would
visit the webpage would have access to this information on a live chart.

This is an old image I managed to find of and old version of the scapper application working.
